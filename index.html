        <p>[I'm the type of person who is positive about every aspect of life.
            There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. 
            I like to play rugby, watch movies and sometimes I like to just 
            sit and think.I'm also interested in traveling to new places and 
            experiencing their cuisine, culture and possibly acquiring some 
            understanding of their language.I've decided to do this course because
	    i've always been interested in how websites are made and how i can build
	    one myself.I think of it as a skill worth acquiring and i'm looking forward
	    to how much more i can learn.].</p>
